# Packet Sniffer

This packet sniffing tool is designed to intercept and analyze network traffic in real-time. It provides two main functionalities:

- **Real-time Keyword Alert**: Alerts the viewer whenever a packet containing a user-defined keyword is detected.
- **Credential Collection**: Collects user credentials (such as username, password, and cookies) from packets and stores them into a file.
